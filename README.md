# Restaurant-Management-Application
Created a Restaurant Management Application with the help of Spring Boot. Here I have used the basic Java concept to create the business logic.
for creating the application I have used Spring MVC(Model View Controller) architecture.
The Application performs multiple tasks like creating a list of restaurants and in the list, we can perform CRUD operations like creating the list of Restaurants, reading the list of restaurants, updating the list based on the restaurant id, and deleting a particular restaurant from the list.

## Controller
A controller is a package in which we have a restroController class that deals with all the APIs.

## Services
A Service is a package in which we have written all the business logic for creating the Restaurant Management Application.

## Repository
For storing the data we have used ArrayList. Here we have created an ArrayList which will store all the data.

## Summary
The restaurant management Application is designed with Spring Boot which has functionalities like managing a list of restaurants their specialty, contact number, and address and we can update the specialty and other details. we have divided the restaurants into different categories like cafes, fine dining, and many more.
